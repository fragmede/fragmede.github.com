I've know about "GitHub":http://github.com since, well, they
started. I didn't follow them or used them or anything, but now
with pages.github.com, I felt compelled to try.

At first it was an interesting test for static pages, then I read
their 'simple, blog aware, static site generator' and am currently
testing it.

I'm sold. 

Now, I'm sold because Git allows me to use my, admittedly,
terminal, not-windows-based workflow and just keep working. It
took very little to do a preliminary site and I get to keep using
git!
