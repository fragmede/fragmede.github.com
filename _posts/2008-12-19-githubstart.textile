I've know about "GitHub":http://github.com since, well, they
started. I didn't follow them or used them or anything, but now
with pages.github.com, I felt compelled to try.

At first it was an interesting test for static pages, then I read their 'simple, blog aware, static site generator' and am currently testing it.
